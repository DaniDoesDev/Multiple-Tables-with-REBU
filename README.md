# Multiple-Tables-with-REBU

This is a Codecademy Project intended for practice using SQL.

I worked with a dataset of statistics from a simulated ride-sharing company called "REBU". This consisted of three separate tables: trip information, user data, and autonomous car data. I wrote queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a specific set of questions (specified in the comments).
